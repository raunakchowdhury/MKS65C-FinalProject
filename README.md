# Coup
## Team Members â€” Michael Ye and Raunak Chowdhury

### Description
Our project will be an emulation of the card game Coup. In the game, players seek to eliminate other players using randomly chosen powers and bluffing their way to victory.

### Required Libraries
None

### Instructions to use project

1. In other terminals, run `make rclient args="*.stuy.edu"`.
